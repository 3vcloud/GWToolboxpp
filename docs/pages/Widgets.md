## Timer
The timer shows the *instance time* of the current map, meaning for how long the instance/map/district has been running.

## Health
The health monitor shows your target's current health, maximum health, and health as a percentage.

Until you directly affect the health of an agent (see a pop-up number over it), you will only be able to see the percentage. If its maximum health changes (e.g. a player using a cupcake or getting a morale boost), the health monitor won't show this until you affect its health again.

## Distance
The distance monitor shows your distance from your target as a percentage of compass range and in GW distance units (gwinches).

## [Minimap](minimap)
The minimap is an improved version of the default Guild Wars compass, with such features as targeting, zoom, and accurate pathing maps.

## Clock
The clock simply shows your local time of day. You can choose 12 or 24-hour clock.
