# Widgets
Unlike [Windows](windows), widgets are designed to stay open all the time, as part of your user interface. Mostly widgets are non-interactive, and just display information.

All widgets have options in [Settings](settings) to specify the exact co-ordinates of their on-screen position and prevent the widget from being moved around or re-sized.

## Interface
* Click and drag on the lower right corner to re-size a widget.
* Click and drag anywhere to move a widget.
  
There are several ways to open and close widgets:
* Checkboxes in the [Info](info) window.
* Checkboxes in the right of each header on [Settings](settings).
* Chat command `/hide (name of widget)`.
* Chat command `/show (name of widget)`.
* Chat command `/tb (name of widdget)` to toggle show/hide.

## Timer
The timer shows the *instance time* of the current map, meaning for how long the instance/map/district has been running.

## Health
The health monitor shows your target's current health, maximum health, and health as a percentage.

Until you directly affect the health of an agent (see a pop-up number over it), you will only be able to see the percentage. If its maximum health changes (e.g. a player using a cupcake or getting a morale boost), the health monitor won't show this until you affect its health again.

## Distance
The distance monitor shows your distance from your target as a percentage of compass range and in GW distance units (gwinches).

## [Minimap](minimap)
The minimap is an improved version of the default Guild Wars compass, with such features as targeting, zoom, and accurate pathing maps.

## Damage
*work in progress*

## Bonds

## Clock
The clock simply shows your local time of day. You can choose 12 or 24-hour clock.
