# Windows

Unlike [Widgets](widgets), windows are designed to be opened when needed, and hidden when not in use.

The header (colored bar at the top, with the window's name) can be used to move the window around by clicking and dragging. Double-clicking the header minimizes the window. The button on the right side of the header closes the window.

All windows have options in [Settings](settings) to specify the exact co-ordinates of their on-screen position, prevent the window from being moved around or re-sized, and to remove the close button.

## Main window
The main Toolbox window contains buttons to open each of the other windows (except the notepad), and a button to activate/de-activate auto pcons.

The close button on the top-right of the main window closes the whole of Toolbox.

## [Pcons](pcons)
Automatically pops cons and pcons.

## [Hotkeys](hotkeys)
Sets up hotkeys for various Toolbox functions.

## [Builds](builds)
Sends team builds to party chat.

## [Travel](travel)
Fast travel to any outpost in the game.

## [Dialogs](dialogs)
Sends dialogs to NPCs.

## [Info](info)
Displays various pieces of useful information.

## [Materials](materials)
Automatically buys materials from the trader.

## [Settings](settings)
All Toolbox settings can be found here.

## Notepad
The notepad is just a space where you can write (or copy/paste) anything you want, such as complicated instructions to remember. Anything you write will still be there when you restart Toolbox or Guild Wars.
