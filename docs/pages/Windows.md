# Windows

*work in progress*

Unlike [Widgets]{widgets), windows are designed to be opened when needed, and hidden when not in use. Windows all have a close button in the top right corner.

All windows have options in [Settings](settings) to specify the exact co-ordinates of their on-screen position, prevent the window from being moved around or re-sized, and to remove the close button.

## Main window

## [Pcons](pcons)

## [Hotkeys](hotkeys)

## [Builds](builds)

## [Travel](travel)

## [Dialogs](dialogs)

## Settings

## Notepad
The notepad is just a space where you can write (or copy/paste) anything you want, such as complicated instructions to remember. Anything you write will still be there when you restart Toolbox or Guild Wars.
