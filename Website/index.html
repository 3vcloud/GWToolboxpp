<h3 id="faqs">FAQs</h3>

<p><strong>Will I get banned for using GWToolbox++?</strong> <br>
We can’t say. Toolbox++ is not a bot as it it does not play the game for you, however it does use the same technology that bots use. What we can say, though, is that as far as we know no one has ever been banned for it since it was created years ago.</p>

<p><strong>I am getting an error message saying “msvcr120.dll” is missing, what’s wrong?</strong> <br>
Please install the Microsoft Visual C++ 2013 Redistributable  found <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=40784">here</a>. <br>
You will want to select <em>vcredist_x86.exe</em> to download and install.</p>

<p><strong>I am getting an error message saying “d3dx9_43.dll (or some other d3d9 dll) is missing”, how fix?</strong> <br>
Please install the DirectX Redistributable found <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=8109">here</a>. You will want to extract the package in a folder in your computer and then run <code>DXSETUP.exe</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Can I run Toolbox++ with other programs such as GWMultilaunch, TexMod, uMod, or a screen recording software?</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>GWMultilaunch is not a problem, if you have multiple clients open Toolbox++ will ask which client to use.</li>
<li>TexMod or uMod <em>should</em> work. You probably want to run them first, and Toolbox++ later. uMod with dll-drop method is recommended.</li>
<li>Screen recording software <em>should</em> work. You probably want to launch them last, after Toolbox++. If you can, use <code>window capture</code> instead of <code>game capture</code>. <br>
Note that TexMod, uMod, screen recording software (in game capture mode) and Toolbox++ all use similar techniques to capture and display information on the screen. Because of this, they may interfere with each other. Also note that when you use more than one of the above programs Guild Wars may crash when you close any of them.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>I run the launcher and then nothing happens / Guild Wars closes / crashes</strong> <br>
There may be different reasons for this. Try the following, in no particular order: <br>
* Launch both Guild Wars and Toolbox++ as administrator. <br>
* Launch Toolbox++ while Guild Wars is running in windowed mode, not minimized or fullscreen. <br>
* Avoid using other programs that interact with Guild Wars (TexMod, uMod, MultiLaunch, screen recording software, game overlays such as steam and others) <br>
* (unlikely) Add GWToolbox.exe and gw.exe to your antivirus whitelist.</p>

<p><strong>I run the launcher and I get the message “GWToolbox.dll was not loaded, unknown error”</strong> <br>
This error typically means that some security feature is preventing Toolbox++ to access Guild Wars. One such feature is Data Execution Prevention, it is disabled by default but if enabled you need to add gw.exe to its whitelist. The other security programs causing this is any particularly zealous antivirus software. You typically need to add both GWToolbox.exe and gw.exe to its whitelist.</p>

<p><strong>GWToolbox++ just crashed and set my grandmas hair on fire! Help!</strong> <br>
Oops. Please start a bug issue at the repository issue tracker <a href="https://bitbucket.org/ggori/gwtoolbox-plusplus/issues/new">here</a> immediately. If the error was not critical, a message box should have displayed with the title “GWToolbox++ Crash!”. If the message box states that the dump file generated sucessfully, please go to your start menu search bar and type %LOCALAPPDATA%. Press enter, and your appdata folder should open. Navigate to the GWToolboxpp folder and find the most recent .dmp file created. If you are able to find the file, attach this file on your issue as it can help greatly with fixing the issue. Be sure to also include what you were doing in game at the time of the crash, and any other information that might help. If it is an issue we can solve we will get to fixing it when we can.</p>

<p><strong>I have an feature request/non-bug issue with GWToolbox++. Where can I voice it?</strong> <br>
We are always open to comments and criticism about Toolbox++. If you have features or opinions of features you would like to voice to the developers, please leave your input on the repository issue tracker found <a href="https://bitbucket.org/ggori/gwtoolbox-plusplus/issues/new">here</a>. Please make sure to select either <em>enhancement</em> or <em>proposal</em> for this type of request.</p>

<p><strong>Can I view the GWToolbox++ source code?</strong> <br>
Yes. The git repository, along with the most recent revision of source is publicly available <a href="https://bitbucket.org/ggori/gwtoolbox-plusplus/src">here</a>.</p>

In the second row there is a checkbox, a hotkey field and a <strong>Run</strong> button. <br>
Checkbox will enable or disable the hotkey, <strong>Run</strong> will execute the hotkey (even if disabled). In order to set a key, click on the hotkey field and then press the key. Modifier keys Control, Alt and Shift are supported.</p>

<p>First of all, press Edit in any row, and write or paste your team build, save with <strong>ok</strong> or cancel and then click on the team build name to send it to chat.</p>

<p>Note that copy, cut and paste work on the <strong>entire</strong> text box, ignoring the cursor.</p>



<h4 id="travel">Travel</h4>

<p>You can travel to any town or use one of the fast travel buttons. Additionally, you can set up to 3 favorite towns for fast access. </p>

<p>The District combo box affects all travel actions in the panel.</p>



<h4 id="dialogs">Dialogs</h4>

<p>You can use the buttons to easily send the correspondent dialog. You can also set up to 3 favorite quests to take or complete. Finally, you can send other dialogs from the combo box or a custom one in the last row.</p>

<p>Note that you need to talk to the relevant NPC before using any dialog</p>



<h4 id="info">Info</h4>

<p>In the top half of the panel you can see information that may help setting up hotkeys.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Player Position</strong> shows x and y coordinates of the player</li>
<li><strong>Target ID</strong> shows the ID (PlayerNumber) of the current target</li>
<li><strong>Map ID</strong> shows the ID of the current map</li>
<li><strong>First Item ID</strong> shows the ID (ModelID) of the first item in the inventory (top left in Backpack)</li>

</ul>

<p>You can toggle the widgets <strong>Bonds Monitor</strong>, <strong>Target Health</strong> and <strong>Target Distance</strong> by clicking on the correspondent checkbox.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Bonds Monitor</strong> is typically focused for E/Mo, shows the currently maintained <strong>Balth</strong>, <strong>Prot</strong> and <strong>Life</strong> bonds on the team. You can also cast or drop bonds by clicking on each slot.</li>
<li><strong>Target Health</strong> shows the health of the current target both in percentage and absolute values</li>
<li><strong>Target Distance</strong> shows the distance to the current target both in percentage of radar range and absolute in-game units. For reference Radar Range is about 5000, Spirit Range is 2500, casting range is 1200 and aggro range is 1000.</li>
<li><strong>Party Damage</strong> shows the damage done by each player in your party. You will see the absolute value and the percentage of the total party damage done. The background of each row also shows visually the amount. Finally, a thin bar will show recent damage in real time, this value resets for each player after a few seconds of not doing damage. You can reset the count with <code>/damage reset</code> and you can write the results to team chat with <code>/damage report</code>. Note that toolbox is only able to detect damage done in radar range.</li>
</ul>

<p>Finally, there is a button to <strong>Open Xunlai Chest</strong> from anywhere in an outpost.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Open tabs on the left</strong> will open panels on the left instead of right side.</li>
